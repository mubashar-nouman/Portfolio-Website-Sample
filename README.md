## Introduction

A personal portfolio website is a digital resume and a showcase of your work. It allows you to tell your story, highlight your skills and achievements, and provide a way for others to get in touch with you. This project provides a basic template for creating your own personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Your portfolio website will look great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Project Showcase**: Highlight your best projects with images, descriptions, and links.
- **About Me Section**: Introduce yourself and share your background, skills, and interests.
- **Contact Information**: Provide an easy way for visitors to get in touch with you.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the content, colors, and styles to match your personal brand.
- **Easy to Deploy**: Host your website on services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for free.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
- Git installed on your local machine (optional, but recommended for version control).
